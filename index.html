    <h2 id="ABOUT">ABOUT THIS PAGE</h2>
        <p>This page is a school project that I will <em>hopefully</em> learn a basic understanding of HTML coding and CSS style sheets.</p>
    <h2 id="ABOUT">ABOUT ME<img src="media/Profile_pic.jpg" alt="Profilepic" width="50" height="57"/></h2>
        <p>I have been in the tech industry for approximately 10 years, and have minimal knowledge of HTML coding, so am enjoying learning new things that will help me in my every day job. In my free time, my passion is singing.  I can sing a song about <em>anything</em> really.  I participated in a virtual album recording of acapella hymns during the pandemic, and can't wait to participate with a future project in person.</p>
